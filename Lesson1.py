# lesson1.py - Simple Recap of Git & GitHub (Beginner Notes)

# -----------------------------------------
# Welcome to Lesson 1: Git & GitHub!
# In this lesson, we learned about Git and GitHub.
# -----------------------------------------

# What is Git?
# Git is a tool that helps you keep track of changes to your code over time.
# It allows you to save snapshots of your code at different stages, and you can go back to any version at any time.
# Git is important for working with teams and for making sure you don't lose your work.

# What is GitHub?
# GitHub is a website where you can store your Git repositories (projects).
# It makes it easy to share your code with others and collaborate on projects.
# GitHub allows you to upload (push) your code and download (pull) code from other people's repositories.

# -----------------------------------------
# Basic Git Commands:
# -----------------------------------------

# 1. git init
# Starts a new Git project. You run this in your project folder to initialize Git.

# 2. git add .
# Stages all your changes to be saved. This means you're telling Git which changes you want to include in your next commit.

# 3. git commit -m "message"
# Saves your staged changes with a description (message). The message explains what changes you made.

# 4. git push
# Sends your changes to GitHub, so others can see and use them.

# -----------------------------------------
# Conclusion:
# Great job! You now know the basics of Git and GitHub.
# Keep practicing these commands to get more comfortable with using Git for version control.
# Remember, Git helps you manage your code, and GitHub lets you share it with the world!
