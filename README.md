## Python Lessons and To-Do App

### Overview

This repository contains a series of Python lessons and a To-Do List application. The lessons cover various key Python concepts such as basic data types, loops, functions, exception handling, and list manipulation. The To-Do App allows users to manage their tasks, providing functionality to add, view, and delete tasks with proper error handling.

### Lessons Overview:

1. **Lesson 1: Basic Python Operations**  
   - Introduction to basic Python syntax, operators, and arithmetic operations.
   
2. **Lesson 2: Conditional Statements**  
   - Working with `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions in the code.
   
3. **Lesson 3: Loops**  
   - Using `while` and `for` loops to iterate over ranges and lists.
   
4. **Lesson 4: Functions**  
   - Defining and using functions, passing arguments, and returning values.
   
5. **Lesson 5: Lists and List Operations**  
   - Understanding lists and performing various operations such as appending, removing, and slicing.
   
6. **Lesson 6: Exception Handling**  
   - Safeguarding the code by handling exceptions such as division by zero or invalid input.

7. **Lesson 7: While Loops and Ranges**  
   - Using `while` loops for conditional iterations, and demonstrating their use with even numbers and ranges of numbers.
   
8. **Lesson 8: Functions and Return Values**  
   - Creating and using functions to process lists, like squaring numbers, and making decisions based on user input.
   
9. **Lesson 9: Exception Handling in Depth**  
   - Handling various types of errors with `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks, as well as using exception handling in practical applications like ATM withdrawals.

### To-Do List Application

The To-Do List app is a Python program that lets users:
- Add tasks to their list
- View the current list of tasks
- Delete tasks from the list

It also includes input validation and error handling to manage invalid entries gracefully.
